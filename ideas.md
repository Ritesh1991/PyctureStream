# Ideas for Docu & Prasentation

## Presentation
- Style: Technical Sales Pitch as a Consultancy
- Consultancy Name: VAA - Visual Analytics Architects

## Ideas
- Architecture should work on every Cloud Hoster or on Premise:
   - Full control
   - Vendor independent
   
- Don't build a SaaS, enable Customers to build their owb platform instead
   - Ootb Analytics won't let you laverage the full value of your data
   - Beeing able to process & analyse data on your own will be a strategic benefit
   - Privacy: Critical Data
   - Security: Critical Infastructure
   
- Choose Kappa, because:
   - Simplicity of Architecture
   - Consistent technology Stack
   - Proven / widely used
   
- Choose Apache Spark + Kafka
   - Well known
   - Well established
   - Microbatching good enough
   
- The solution won't be good, if:
   - Processing needs to be done in Fragments of a second
   - You do a lot analyses later, because of expense of large amount of data in Queue and in Memory (consider lamba here)
